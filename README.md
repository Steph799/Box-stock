# The project is based on my course in Algorythm & Data-structure.
It manages a stock of boxes. The user can do the following operations: 
- Order boxes.
- Check availability of a certain box.
- Buy boxes.

Note:
- Every box has a square bottom (be aware about the coordinates: you deal with bottom X heigh)
- You can also see all the configurations that define all the stock management
- The project has no UI. Just console
- The project includes built-in data base for checking all the possibilities.
